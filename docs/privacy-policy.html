        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: March 24, 2025</p>

        <p>
          This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
          information when you use our peer-to-peer social networking app.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use the app, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your profile data: name, photo, bio, hometown, field of study (and
            year), and tags
          </li>
          <li>
            Peer interactions: UUIDs of nearby users and the date/time of
            interactions
          </li>
          <li>
            Meetup data: title, description, location, date, and participants
            (UUIDs)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your data is used to enable social connections and interactions
          between nearby users, and to facilitate meetups organized through the
          app.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          All data is stored in Apple's CloudKit. At this stage of development,
          data is not encrypted at rest in a private database. This means your
          profile and interaction data may be accessible in plain form within
          the database.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share your personal data with third parties. Your profile is
          only visible to other users when you come into proximity and exchange
          UUIDs via peer-to-peer communication.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You can request that your data be deleted or modified at any time. To
          do so, contact us at the email below.
        </p>
