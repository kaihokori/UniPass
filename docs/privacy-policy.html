        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: March 24, 2025</p>

        <p>
          This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
          information when you use our peer-to-peer social networking app.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use the app, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your profile data: name, photo, bio, hometown, field of study (and
            year), and tags
          </li>
          <li>
            Peer interactions: UUIDs of nearby users and the date/time of
            interactions
          </li>
          <li>
            Meetup data: title, description, location, date, and participants
            (UUIDs)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your data is used to enable social connections and interactions
          between nearby users, and to facilitate meetups organized through the
          app.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          All user data is stored in Apple's CloudKit service. CloudKit encrypts
          data both in transit and at rest, using Appleâ€™s standard security
          practices. While some profile data is stored in a public database to
          enable social discovery, access is limited to users of the app and is
          not shared with third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We rely on Apple's CloudKit infrastructure to securely store and
          transmit your data. Apple encrypts data at rest and during
          transmission using industry-standard protocols. At this time, we do
          not implement additional encryption or cryptographic algorithms within
          the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share your personal data with third parties. Only your UUID
          is exchanged via peer-to-peer discovery. Profile information is then
          fetched securely from CloudKit using that UUID. No sensitive or
          identifying information is transmitted directly over local
          connections.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You can request that your data be deleted or modified at any time. To
          do so, contact us at the email below.
        </p>
